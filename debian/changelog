rogueportal (1.2) buster; urgency=medium

  * Updated configuration to use dhcpcd instead of /etc/network/interfaces
  * Configuration no longer requires a bridge, so bridge-utils is no longer a
    package dependency.
  * The rogue portal is now configured for wlan0 only, allowing it to work
    alongside another network connection. So, for example, you can now have the
    rogue portal running on wlan0 and still ssh into the pi via a wired
    connection.
